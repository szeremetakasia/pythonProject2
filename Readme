Objective:
The objective of the project is to predict whether a startup turns into a success or a failure. The success of a start up is defined when the company's founders are offered a large sum of money through the process of M&A (Merger and Acquisition) or an IPO (Initial Public Offering). A company would be considered as failed if it had to be shutdown.
For the purpose of this project three data models were built: logistic regression, decision tree (CART) and Random Forest.
